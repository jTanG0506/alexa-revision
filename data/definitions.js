  "ring": "a ring is a set R and two binary operations, called plus and times, which satisfy the following conditions. R1, \
          the set R and the plus operation is an abelian group with identity 0. R2, times is associative. R3, times is distributive \
          over plus. And R4, there exists an element 1 in R, different from 0, that is an identity for times.",
  "subring": "let R be a ring, and S be a subset of R, Then S is a subring of R if it is a ring in its own right with respect to the \

  "division ring": "a division ring is a ring in which every non zero element has a right and left inverse, so for every element r in a ring R, there is an element s in a ring R\
                   such that r times s equals 1, and there is t in R, such that t times r equals 1, in this case, s equals t and we write r to the power minus 1 for this inverse of r, and say\

                  r dashed, equals, theta of r, plus theta of r dashed, and, theta of r times r dashed, equals, theta r, times theta r dashed.",
  "isomorphic": "we say that two rings, R and S, are isomorphic, if there exists an isomorphism from R to S.",
  "homomorphism": "if R and S are rings, then an homomorphism from R to S, is a map, theta from R to S, such that, for all r and r dashed in the ring R, we have, theta of r plus\
                  r dashed, equals, theta of r, plus theta of r dashed, and, theta of r times r dashed, equals, theta r, times theta r dashed, and, theta of the 1 in R, equals, the 1 in S.",
  "embedding": "an embedding is an injective homomorphism.",
  "monomorphism": "an embedding is an injective homomorphism.",
  "kernel": "if theta from R to S, is a homomorphism of rings, then the kernel of theta, is the set of all the elements r in the ring R that gets sent to 0 by theta.",

                     ideal generated by ay, and, a principal ideal is one which can be generated by a single element.",
  "trivial ideal": "the trivial ideal is the set containing just 0, and is the smallest ideal in any ring.",
  "proper ideal": "in every ring, the principal ideal generated by 1, is the ring R itself, and any other ideal is referred to as a proper ideal.",
  "left ideal": "the definition of a left ideal is similar to the one for an ideal, however, the third condition is replaced with a weaker condition, for an element ay in I, and an\
                element r in R, r times ay must be in I.",
  "right ideal": "the definition of a right ideal is similar to the one for an ideal, however, the third condition is replaced with a weaker condition, for an element ay in I, and an\
